# cs393r_starter

## Using this Repo
You will be using a duplicate of this repo for all development in the class. This repo provides starter code for the ROS subscriptions, publishers and control loops you will be using.

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the [UT AUTOmata reference manual]() for instructions on setting up the dependencies:
* [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
* [amrl_msgs](https://github.com/ut-amrl/amrl_msgs)
* [amrl_maps](https://github.com/ut-amrl/amrl_maps)
* [ut_automata](https://github.com/ut-amrl/ut_automata)

### Duplicate the Repo
1. Make sure you're logged into your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repo with the same name under your GitHub account. Dont initialize that with anything.
3. `git clone <this repository url>` (found in the upper right)
4. `cd <cloned_repo>`
5. `git push --mirror <your new repository url>`

### Clone and Build
1. `git clone <your repository url>` (found in the upper right)
2. After you have cloned the repo, add it to your ROS path by adding the following line to the end of `~/.bashrc`:   
    ```
    export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:[Local path to your repo]
    ```
    For example:
    ```
    export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/home/joydeepb/cs393r_starter
    ```
3. Reload `.bashrc` so that the path is updated:
    ```
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
4. `cd <cloned_repo>`
5. `make -j`

### Optional: Building/Running with Docker
1. Make sure you have Docker installed and set up.
2. Make sure you are in the root directory of the repository.
3. Run `make docker_all` to just compile. 
4. You can run `make docker_shell` to get a shell within the Docker container. The shell will automatically launch `roscore` and the `ut_automata` websocket and simulator inside of a `tmux` session. Inside the shell, you can compile and run your navigation code and connect using localhost in the web visualization. 

For debugging purposes, you can look at the tmux processes at any time by attaching to the session: `tmux a -t ROS`. For more information about `tmux`, refer to the [tmux documentation](https://tmuxguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tmux/tmux.html)
5. To shutdown the docker container, run `make docker_stop`

### Code Overview
There are three main executables: `navigation`, `particle_filter`, and `slam`. Each executable has a corresponding `.h` and `.cc` file that defines the class for the implementation. An associated `*_main.cc` file abstracts away ROS-specific details. For example, the `particle_filter` executable consists of three files:
```
src
└── particle_filter
    ├── particle_filter.cc
    ├── particle_filter.h
    └── particle_filter_main.cc
```
Every header file includes documentation in comments for the variables and subroutines.  
The project compiles with [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for linear algebra and coordinate geometry, the [amrl_shared_lib](https://github.com/ut-amrl/amrl_shared_lib) for commonly used robotics subroutines, and a custom simple priority queue implementation. Some useful references on how to use the libraries:
* See the included [`eigen_tutorial.cc`](src/eigen_tutorial.cc) file for example most common Eigen usage, and the [official Eigen tutorials](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html) for more extensive documentation.
* See the included [`simple_queue_test.cc`](src/navigation/simple_queue_test.cc) for usage of the simple priority queue.

### Running the Code
Make sure you recompile your code between changes.
* To run navigation:
    ```
    ./bin/navigation
    ```
* To run the particle filter:
    ```
    ./bin/particle_filter
    ```
* To run SLAM:
    ```
    ./bin/slam
    ```
